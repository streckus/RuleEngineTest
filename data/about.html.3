<h1>About ISGCI</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Over the years, the mathematics and computer science communities have
described many special graph classes in an attempt to enlarge both
our understanding of fundamental properties of graphs, and our ability to
solve practical problems efficiently.  This work has been - and still is -
so fruitful that a large number of classes have been defined, whose relations
are difficult to overview even for the initiated. In an attempt to make this
field more accessible the book
<em>Graph Classes - A Survey</em> by A. Brandstaedt, V.B. Le, J. Spinrad
documents over 300 classes. ISGCI goes one step further, by allowing the
user to examine the relation between graph classes interactively. ISGCI
provides the user with
</p>
<ul>
   <li> drawings of classes and their relations</li>
   <li> references on classes and their relations</li>
   <li> colouring of class diagrams according to the computational complexity
   of selected problems</li>
   <li> references to algorithms or complexity proofs for selected problems</li>
</ul>

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Version 1</h3>
<p>
Version 1.0 was created in 1999 at Rostock University, Department of Computer
Science, by F. Siegemund under supervision of T.  Szymczak after an idea by A.
Brandstaedt and V.B. Le. It consisted solely of a Java 1.0 applet and contained
classes and inclusions, but no information on problems and hence no colouring.
The only information available on classes were their names, in Latex, not
formatted.  Despite its simplicity, it was an excellent basis to determine the
use of such a system as well the limitations of the implementation. The two
foremost limitations perceived were maintainability and the fact that
inclusions that were obvious from the definition of a graphclass were often not
in the system. Version 2 was created to cure these limitations.
</p>

<h3>Version 2</h3>
<p>
Version 2 was released in 2001 and was created by S. Knorr, M. Rzehak, and
H.N. de Ridder with the last one supervising. The web pages were designed by K.
Erdmann. H.N. de Ridder has been responsible for ISGCI ever since. Version 2
was written in Java 1.1 and consisted of a complete rewrite of the applet and a
new application to deduce inclusions automatically. From now on, e.g.
P<sub>4</sub>-free would not just be a name, but define a graphclass by
forbidding the subgraph P<sub>4</sub>.
</p>

<p>
During the years 2001-2008 many improvements were made to version 2. The
deduction algorithms were extended and improved (D. Bayer, N. Ryabova, H.N.
de Ridder), the data storage was changed to XML (N. Ryabova, H.N. de Ridder),
references were linked to ZMATH entries (D. Bayer, U. Nagel, T.  Teige),
problems were added (H.N. de Ridder), drawings of smallgraphs were added (M.
Mowitz, H.N. de Ridder and others), web pages for classes with definitions
etc. were added (H.N. de Ridder), searching in the web pages and in the
applet was implemented (D.  Bayer, H.N. de Ridder). Finally many other
improvements were made to the system and an enormous amount of data was
added (H.N. de Ridder).
</p>

<p>
However, technology was changing and the applet became unusable in modern
Java systems, because the applet was still written using the AWT graphics
toolkit and Java had switched to Swing. This was cured by version 3.
</p>

<h3>Version 3</h3>
<p>
Version 3 was released in 2010 and was created by H.N. de Ridder. It
replaced the AWT visualization code by Swing, switched from applet to jnlp
application and improved the layout of the web pages using the capabilities
of modern browsers. In the summer of 2012, Nathann Cohen added an interface to
the ISGCI database in the <a href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a>
mathematics system.
Version 3 is the current release and further improvements to the system itself
and to its contents will be made.
</p>

<h2>Some statistics</h2>
<p>
Since version 1.0 in 1999, ISGCI has become faster, more stable, more
capable and better informed.  In June 2003, the database contained over 600
classes and more than 36,000 inclusions. In March 2010, the number of classes
has grown to more than 1000 and the number of inclusions to more than
100,000. Interestingly, the number of inclusions remained at about 10% of
the square of the number of classes throughout the history of ISGCI.
</p>

<p>
In August 2010, the database contained 1109 classes and 114,524 inclusions.
To obtain these, the system investigated/deduced 4252 classes and 3,253,127
inclusions. Of these, 3,236,623 or 99.5% were proper inclusions, 13,052 or
0.4% were equalities and for 3452 or 0.1% the system could not determine
whether the inclusion is proper or in fact an equality.
</p>

<p>
The database contained 1394 references, 1108 or 80% of which had a ZMATH
link. 100% of the algorithms in the system and 92% of the inclusions had a
reference. The remaining inclusions were deduced automatically in multiple
steps over graph classes that were generated automatically and deleted
afterwards.
</p>

<h2>Future</h2>
<p>
We will continue to improve the software and to extend the database by new
classes, inclusions and algorithms. We appreciate it very much if you would
<a href="contact.html">contact</a> us if you find an error or
omission in the software or the
database, if you have an idea for a new feature, or if you have described a
new graph class or algorithm.
